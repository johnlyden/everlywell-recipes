## Everlywell Frontend Engineering Challenge

### Recipe Finder using TheMealDB public API

#### Completed Features in allotted 4 Hours
- search for recipes
- styling based on spec
- view details of recipe in modal
- by default load 5 random recipes
- ability to favorite a recipe and storing in application state ( time ran out before connecting favorites with localStorage )
#### I wanted to implement the saving the to localStorage and add comments to my code, so I created another branch ```extra``` where you can find what I did with an extra hour of time.
